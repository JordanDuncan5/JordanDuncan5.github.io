    <h1>My name is Jordan Duncan</h1>
    <p>I'm a student at Wake Tech aspiring to be a computer programmer. I'm originally from Atlanta, and I moved to North Carolina 
        my first year of high school, and have enjoyed my stay. Some things I enjoy include 
        relaxation, watching sports, playing video games, and hanging out with friends.
